# Summary for Destroy_CCCLayer.cs

Class Name: Destroy_CCCLayer
Purpose: This class is responsible for destroying the GameObject of this script if it is not inside the Cornea_Geo (1) collider. The script creates an instance of itself and checks whether it is inside the Cornea_Geo (1) collider using the `OnTriggerEnter` and `OnTriggerExit` methods. If the script is not inside the Cornea_Geo (1) collider, it destroys its GameObject using the `Destroy` method provided by Unity Engine.

Public Methods:

* `Awake()` - This method is called when the script is initially loaded. It checks if an instance of this class already exists and initializes the class if one does not exist.
* `OnTriggerExit(Collider other)` - This method listens to any collisions with objects that have a collider, checks if the collided object is Cornea_Geo (1) and if so, disables the current GameObject using the SetActive(false) method provided by Unity Engine.
* `OnTriggerStay(Collider other)` - This method listens to any collisions with objects that have a collider, checks if the collided object is Cornea_Geo (1) and if so, marks the script as being inside Cornea_Geo (1) using the Boolean variable isInsideCornea.

Dependencies: `UnityEngine`

In this code, the `Monobehavior` class is inherited to create a new class named Destroy_CCCLayer. It has two public methods and three private methods. The public method `Awake()` checks if the `Instance` is present in the system. And upon creating a new Instance it sets the `instance`. If there is already an instance, then the existing object is destroyed using the `Destroy()` method.

The purpose of this script is two-fold:

1. It checks if a GameObject is inside the Cornea_Geo (1) collider and disables its activation, by setting the boolean variable `isInsideCornea` to false. It does so through using the `OnTriggerExit()` method.
2. If a GameObject leaves the cornea geometry, then it destroys the current object using the `Destroy()` method.
