# Summary for SliderAnimation.cs


Class Name: SliderAnimation

Purpose: This class creates a new animation on the UI slider component in Unity Engine by using the Animator and Slider classes. It allows for animating a UI slider's movement through animation clips of the player's character.

Public Methods:

* `void Start()`: The program is called once per animation. The function `GetComponent<Animator>()` is used here to obtain the Animator component, and `speed` is set to zero.
*  ` void Update()`: The update loop starts here for the current iteration. In this case, it plays an "animation" clip through the `"CCCAnimation"` transition using anim.Play() with a parameter of `-1` set for the slider, which specifies the `normalizedValue`.
