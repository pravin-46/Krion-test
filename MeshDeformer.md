# Summary for MeshDeformer.cs


Class Name: MeshDeformer

Purpose: The MeshDeformer class is responsible for deforming a mesh object in a scene using the user's mouse input. It uses physics raycasting to determine where on the mesh the user has clicked and adds forces to the vertices of the mesh in accordance with the user's input.

Public Methods:

1. Start() - This method is called once during the start of the program, and it is used to initialize the deforming mesh and the variables that control the simulation.
2. Update() - This method is called every frame update, and it is responsible for handling the user's input and updating the vertices of the mesh based on the forces applied.
3. HandleInput() - This method is called in the Update() method to handle the user's mouse input. It casts a ray from the camera towards the mouse position and checks if there are any collisions with the deforming mesh before applying forces to the vertices of the mesh.
4. AddDeformingForce(Vector3 point, float force) - This method takes in a point and a force value and applies a force to all vertices of the deforming mesh that is in the direction of the point.
5. AddForceToVertex(int i, Vector3 point, float force, float time) - This method adds a force to a specific vertex of the deforming mesh based on the given position and force values. It also updates the velocity of the vertex based on the spring force and damping parameters.
6. UpdateVertex(int i) - This method updates the position of a specific vertex of the deforming mesh based on its velocity. It also checks if the vertex is close enough to the original position of the vertex to stop simulating the displacement after some time passes.

Dependencies: The MeshDeformer class requires the use of UnityEngine libraries for physics raycasting and matrix operations.
