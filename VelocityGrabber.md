# Summary for VelocityGrabber.cs


Class Name: VelocityGrabber
Purpose: This class is responsible for grabbing the velocity of a rigidbody component attached to this game object. The velocity is retrieved using the Rigidbody.velocity property and is then stored in a variable for later use.

Public Methods:

* Method Name: Start
Parameters: None
Description: This method is called when the script is started, either by a user or through code. It initializes any necessary variables or systems.
Returns: None

* Method Name: Update
Parameters: None
Description: This method is called once per frame and allows for velocity calculation during runtime. It retrieves the current velocity of the rigidbody and updates the stored velocity variable.
Returns: None

Dependencies:

* Rigidbody
* MonoBehaviour (which is a base class of VelocityGrabber)

In this code, the VelocityGrabber class uses Unity's Rigidbody component to retrieve the velocity of a game object. The Start and Update methods are the main entry points for the script, which are called automatically by Unity at runtime. The velocity is stored in a variable for later use and can be retrieved using the Velocity property of the Rigidbody class. This class does not have any dependencies other than the Rigidbody component and inherits from MonoBehaviour.
