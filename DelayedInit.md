# Summary for DelayedInit.cs

 Summary:
------------ 

The DelayedInit class in the provided C# code extends the MonoBehaviour class and contains three public GameObject fields: audio09, audio10, and audio11. It also contains two methods, Start() and Update(). The Start method is called before the first frame update and sets the state of these three fields to "inactive".  
The Update method is called once per frame and is empty for now. 

The class has an IEnumerator called "audioOn09" that takes up the coroutine, which starts after a 6â€“second wait. This coroutine yields for two waits of 11f and 9f respectively, then sets the inactive state of these three GameObject instances to true. The coroutine is not currently being used but has been left in the code by the developer.  

Dependencies:
--------------

This class depends on UnityEngine namespace that defines classes for game objects and behaviors. StartCoroutine() calls a coroutine that yields and allows other functions to run between each "yield return new WaitForSeconds()". The GetComponent<>() method is also used in the start method, which retrieves a component attached to the current GameObject with the specified type, creating one if not already exists.
