# Summary for rotateObject.cs


Class Name: rotateObject

Purpose: This class is used to create a rotating effect for the game object attached to it. It listens for mouse events and adjusts the rotation of the object based on the user's input.

Public Methods:

* Update(): Contains the main loop of the script, which checks for mouse events and updates the rotation of the object accordingly.
* Start(): Initializes the script and sets the starting position of the mouse reference.
* OnMouseDown(): Sets a flag indicating that the user is rotating the object and stores the current mouse position as the starting point.
* OnMouseUp(): Resets the flag indicating that the user is rotating the object and sets the rotation to its initial state.

Dependencies:

* UnityEngine namespace for accessing engine functionality such as raycasting and mouse input.
* System.Collections namespace for working with collections in C#.

This script demonstrates the use of raycasting, which is a method used to accurately trace the path of a ray (a straight line) in 3D space. By casting a ray from the camera through the object, we can determine if the user has clicked on the object and interact with it accordingly. The script also uses mouse input to rotate the object based on user input, allowing for smooth and controlled rotation.
