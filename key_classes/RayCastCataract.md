# Summary for RayCastCataract.cs

Class Name: RayCastCataract

Purpose: This class is responsible for casting a ray from the player's perspective and determining whether it hits a specific object in the scene, such as a cataract. If it does hit the object, it will update the color of the underlying texture to correspond with the cataract's color.

Public Methods:

* Start() - This method is called when the script instance is initially created. It retrieves a reference to the VibrationDemoScript component and sets up some internal variables.
* Update() - This method is called every frame and is responsible for determining whether the player aims the beam at the cataract or not.
* PhacoChopAudioCheck() - This method is responsible for playing audio when the player chops the cataract using their hand motion. It starts a coroutine to play audio after 3 seconds of aiming the beam at the object, and then it checks whether the input has been canceled or not.
* TextureToTexture2D() - This method is responsible for converting a texture from the underlying material into a Texture2D format which can be used for pixel-based operations.

Dependencies:

* VibrationDemoScript: This script is used to provide haptic feedback to the user when the beam hits the cataract.
* Audio: This object is responsible for playing the audio when the player chops the cataract.
* CataractColorChanger: This class is responsible for maintaining the status of the current color of the cataract, and changing it accordingly when the beam hits it.
