This code has the following methods:

* constructor `LensColorChanger` - This method is responsible for initializing instance variables and setting up the game object's material properties. It is called when a new instance of this class is constructed, usually during the initialization process of the game engine.
* `Start()` - This method is called once by the Unity Engine after the class has been instantiated, providing it with an opportunity to start coroutines and perform one-time setup.
* `Update()` - This method is called every frame, allowing the instance to update its internal state based on the current game state. It also contains code that reacts to user input and performs various tasks during different parts of the game.

This class is a representation of the lens color changer object which can change the color of the material when certain buttons are pressed.
It has the following properties:
* `duration` - the duration for the transition from one color to another.
* `time` - a value that represents how much time has passed since the start of the transition.
* `isStarted` - a boolean indicating whether the transition has started.
* `isChanged` - a boolean indicating whether the color has been changed .
* `mat` - The instance variable for the material associated with this class, which is used to set the color of the lens.
* `Tswitch` - The instance variable of `ToolSwitch`, which contains information about the currently selected tool and fluid index if any.
* `HP` - The instance variable of `HapticPlugin`, which contains information about the buttons that are being pressed.
* `EyeBallTrigger` - The instance variable of `IsInsideEyeBall`, which is used to check if the user's gaze is within a specific distance from the lens.
* `start_color` and  End_Color` - These variables are the initial and final colors of the material in question.
* `audio12` - This is a GameObject that contains an audio file named "blue".
* `StartCoroutine(bluCheck2())` - This method starts a coroutine that checks if the user's gaze has passed a certain distance from the lens, and if it has then it activates the blue audio.
* `IEnumerator bluCheck1()`- This method is an implementation of a coroutine that waits for 0.1 seconds and then checks if the user's input meets certain conditions, and if it does then it activates the blue audio.
* `IEnumerator bluCheck2()`- This method is another implementation of a coroutine that waits for 0.1 seconds and then checks if the user's input meets certain conditions, and if it does then it starts a new coroutine to check if the user's gaze has passed a certain distance from the lens and if it has then it activates the blue audio.
* `IEnumerator ChangedTruetemp()`- This method  is another implementation of a coroutine that waits for 0.001 seconds and then sets the variable `isChanged` to true.
