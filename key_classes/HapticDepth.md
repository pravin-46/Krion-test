# Summary for HapticDepth.cs


Class Name: HapticDepth

Purpose: This class is responsible for managing the haptic feedback and visual cues in a Unity application. It contains two public methods, one for handling input events and another for updating the game objects' visibilities based on the user's actions. The class also sets the visibility of four GameObjects to true or false depending on the input received from the player.

Public Methods:

1. Start() - This method is called once when the script is enabled, and it sets the initial state of the game objects. It activates the hapticone and deactivates the other three game objects.
2. Update() - This method is called every frame, and it checks for input events. If the player presses the X button, it activates the haptictwo game object and deactivates the modelone game object, and if the player presses the Z button, it sets all four game objects to active.
3. firstcut() - This method is not publicly accessible and serves no functional purpose in this code snippet. It may have been a leftover from a larger project or an experimental feature that was never used.
