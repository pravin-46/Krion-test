# Summary for SuckerForPain.cs

Class Name: SuckerForPain

Purpose: The purpose of this class is to determine when a collision occurs between the player and an object, and then to move that object to a new location based on the player's input.

Public Methods:

* Start(): This method is called at the start of the game or level. It initializes several variables to their default values.
* Update(): This method is called every frame, and it checks for changes in the player's input and updates accordingly.
* OnCollisionEnter(Collision collisionInfo): This method is called whenever a collision occurs with an object that has a layer of 12 (which is set to "SuckRegion" in Unity). It retrieves information about the collision, such as the gameObject and its position, and sets some variable values based on that information.
* OnCollisionStay(Collision collisionInfo): This method is called every frame while a collision with an object of layer 12 continues. It checks the player's input for the "JHorizontal" axis (which corresponds to the left/right arrow keys) and checks if the value is larger than 0.65 (this means that the player wants to suck the object).
* OnCollisionExit(Collision collisionInfo): This method is called whenever a collision with an object of layer 12 ends. It resets some variable values that were set during the previous collision.
* InTriggerStay(Collider other): This method is called every frame while there is a trigger (such as a collider) overlapping with this object. It checks if the name of the trigger object is "SuckRegion" and sets a boolean value based on that.
* InTriggerExit(Collider other): This method is called whenever there is no longer a trigger overlap between this object and another object (such as a collider). It resets the boolean value that was set during the previous trigger overlap.
