# Summary for DrawWithMouseCat.cs


Class Name: DrawWithMouseCat

Purpose: This class is used to draw with the mouse on a Unity3D editor, specifically on a scene where we want to add snow. The user can move the mouse pointer to different parts of the screen and trigger drawing actions by clicking on the desired location. Once the drawing is done, the rendered image is stored in a Render Texture for further processing.

Public Methods:

1. ToStart() - This method initializes the DrawWithMouseCat class and creates a new material with the provided shader. It also sets the texture of the snow material to the new RenderTexture.
2. Update() - This method is called each frame update, and it contains code for handling mouse clicks. If the user clicks on the screen while holding down the left mouse button, the method checks if a physics raycast with the camera's projection of the mouse position intersects any objects in the game scene. If so, it retrieves the hit information from the raycast, and then uses that information to draw the image onto the RenderTexture using the provided material.
3. DrawToShader() - This method is called when the user clicks on a specific location on the screen. It takes in a Raycast Hit hit as an argument and retrieves the coordinates of the texture coordinate of the intersection point from the hit information. Then, it creates a temporary RenderTexture, blits the contents of the original RenderTexture onto the temporary one, applies the provided material to the temporary RenderTexture, then blits the temporary RenderTexture back onto the original RenderTexture using the Graphics class' Blit() method. Finally, it releases the temporary RenderTexture.
4. ResetTexture() - This method simply resets the texture of the snow material and also creates a new RenderTexture with the same dimensions as the original one.
